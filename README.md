# Stealth Game TS

**A simple stealth game built with React & TypeScript — inspired by classic stealth games.**

## Project Description
This is a browser-based stealth game where the player controls a character and tries to avoid being found while navigating through a level. The project is a practical exercise in React and TypeScript, exploring the ways how a small game can be built using modern web technologies. I used the source code of a tic-tac-toe game as a starting point and gradually built a more complex system from it. This process led me to develop my own game logic framework.
